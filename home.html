                <h4>Projects</h4>
                <div class="break"></div>
                Currently, I'm working on a web application focused on helping people learn React.js
                . Recognizing the importance of React.js in modern web development, my aim is to
                create a straightforward platform for individuals interested in diving into this
                JavaScript library. The application provides a user-friendly environment with a
                structured curriculum, practical exercises, and interactive features to enhance
                the learning process. The goal is to make React.js education more accessible,
                fostering a community of developers who can confidently utilize this technology in
                their projects. Stay tuned for updates on this project, and feel free to explore
                the application once it's live to kickstart your journey into React.js. Checkout
                my repo provided in the header to stay updated!
