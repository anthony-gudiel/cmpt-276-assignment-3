                <h1>My Education</h1>
                <p>Currently in my second year at Simon Fraser University (SFU), I'm working
                towards graduating in 2026. My time at SFU has been about learning, adapting,
                and growing. I'm focused on my coursework, engaging in projects, and exploring
                my interests. This journey is not just about gaining knowledge but also developing
                a mindset of continuous learning. Each semester builds a foundation for my future.
                I look forward to the challenges and opportunities ahead, aiming to make the most
                of my university experience for a successful and fulfilling future. </p>
