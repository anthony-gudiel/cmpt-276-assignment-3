                <h1> More About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm passionate about blending creativity with technology to find practical solutions.
                Whether it's coding, web development, or exploring new tech trends, I enjoy the versatility
                that technology offers in solving everyday problems. Learning is a big part of my journey,
                and I believe in staying up-to-date with the latest tech developments. Beyond the technical
                side, I'm also committed to building a collaborative and inclusive community in the tech
                space. For me, passion is not just about the tools but about using technology to create
                experiences that matter to people.</p>
